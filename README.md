In our project, we analysed Pothos and Chater (2002)'s formalization that uses the simplicity principle in unsupervised human categorization. 
After analysing their model, we recreated it, applied it to a larger set of point arrangements, and extended the model with more versions (a weighted version, and a version that includes equality). 

The code that was used for this project can be seen in the Code_simplicity_principle file. 

**Authors:** Alsou Bellmann, Paul Bonnie, Kiran Muthu, Donja Schipper, and Mark Špīss
